Reading and Thought Essay
In "Reading and Thought" by Dwight Macdonald, he relates all his points to the abundance of information. He references the past and how the limited amount of information has led to a controlled environment where there is "the time to think and even to feel." He says that we handle abundance by having this superficial manner. He claims that we read and write superficially to avoid wasting time, and because of this, we have lost the ability to be thoughtful. He claims that the problem today is that we are tempted to "acquire too much information," which causes this disjointness of our comprehension and reading. I partially agree with Dwight Macdonald because the abundance of information alone is not the problem.
	First, the development of a superficial manner has negatively affected our reading and thought processes. It's unintentional that the things we read are flying over our heads. We would like to understand what we read, but it seems like we have developed this manner that has prevented us from obtaining the true meaning behind what we read, and, at frequent times, the things we read aren't retainable to be used for other things such as essays. A personal example of this is when I had to read a book for English class. I don't remember the book, but I remember the dreadful moment that came with it. I remember reading and reading, but for some reason, I never was able to comprehend the words until I engaged in the text. It required me to actively remind myself to slowly read and re-read to obtain the meaning behind the words. Even now, the book has not returned to my memories at all. I have no recollection of it, and I struggle to implement other texts I may read into things like essays. I can agree that I have suffered the consequences of the superficial way we read.
	Furthermore, our curiosity has caused us to be addicted to satisfaction. We instinctively love being occupied or entertained by something to avoid boredom. An example of this is the use of social media. Social media platforms such as TikTok are very attention-grabbing apps. Even though the app displays short videos with little to no text, we are curious about what video will appear next. Our curiosity for more information has not benefited us but caused us to steer off things quickly. This habit translates to reading when the things we read are not 
enjoyable. A personal example of this is when I had to read articles relating to a research topic of mine. This topic was neither exciting or interesting. After a few hours of reading different articles about the same research topic, I started losing focus. I started drifting off, looking at other things online besides what I needed to do. I eventually took a short break to reset myself to endure another pounding sensation of redundant information in my brain. When I got back to reading through more articles, I started skimming to find new information about the same topic that was different. This example contradicts what Macdonald's says. He claims that because of the abundance of information, we "glance over '' the things we read, but actually, people glance over the printed text because it's not satisfying to read. 
	Lastly, the abundance of information can lead to issues. Quality reading may worsen because of it, but we may feel more connected by the quantity of information. Yes, our understanding of certain things will not be as deep, but the number of different things that we can know about will surely increase. Macdonald claims that the abundance of information can cause us to be "coarse, shallow, passive, and unoriginal." He says these things in context that when we read, we aren't capable of having our thoughts. When looking at it from a different perspective, in the real world, when someone is widely informed about many things, they tend to struggle to be original. Since things already exist and are known, it's hard to be different. In addition to a real-world point of view, an example can be businesses. Many businesses have the goal of discovering or doing something unique. Being unique is ideal because it attracts consumers, and being original has a great image. This goal is hard to achieve since there is so much competition. Similar to how there is so much information that it's hard to have original thoughts. 
	I understand Dwight Macdonald's view on how the abundance of information has played a role in reading and comprehension. Not having the opportunity to grow up in a time where there is social media and more advanced technology, I can see why he believes it is the cause of our problem. His ideas have opened another perspective on reading and comprehension that is unique. It has never really dawned on me that this issue could be more complex than it is. I was very oblivious about this topic since it's just an issue I deal with now naturally. I intend to keep this idea relatively fresh to use later in different essays I may have to write. I agree with some things he had to say, but I don't think it's the only reason behind this issue. For this reason, I can only partially agree with Dwight Macdonald.
